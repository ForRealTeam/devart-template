In the future (when we produce the actual installation) we would like to add a few limbs and also create a humanoid look to the robots. We are looking for something between a techy, maker, digital look but still with a ‘rounded’ human sensitivity. something people can still relate to and see themselves within, though its apparent that the main attribute that people respond to is the movement and the responsiveness to their own behaviour.
