Today’s personality is a Snapshot guy (or Strobe girl :)
This personality configuration takes movement snapshot samples of positions and fragmentize the user’s natural flow. In the selfie era (Wikipedia link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie) we are used to having total control over our public representation, in this case the robot decides when and where to give its emphasis. The series of movements also becomes a series of moments, maybe a bit of how we experience our lives. 
Thinking about an army of robots, we can use this personality in one robot or in many at once to get (bigger effect obviously)
