We call this personality Patrick after the late Patrick Swayze that taught us all what dance is (at least in our generation). We started by modulating a sinus on single limb angular movement, and realized after some experiments that this will be much more organic if we modulated all limbs but with different phases and tempo.
After perfecting the responsivity we looked at the result and found it very dance like. In an installation scenario when the user stops moving all robots stop moving as well except for the dancer that continues to ‘echo’ the users movement and kind of poeticize it.
