We first set off on creating our DoppelGÃ¤nger prototype. We reflected about the minimal limbs we need to create to have a playful array of movements. After a lengthy discussion we decided to focus on the upper torso, that is the hands and the torso, later adding head and neck. Adding legs would complicate movement, the way we see it, but will not add to personality much.
For the prototype we decided to use 7 servos, one for the torso and 3 for each hand.
  SERVO_BODY_ROTATION - controls the torso movement
  SERVO_RIGHT/LEFT_SHOULDER_PAN - controls shoulder movement on the horizontal axis
  SERVO_RIGHT/LEFT_SHOULDER_TILT - controls shoulder movement on the vertical axis
  SERVO_RIGHT/LEFT_ELBOW - controls the elbow angle
