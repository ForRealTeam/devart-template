We have come a long way from our initial idea and through the realization of the project and  the live tests done so far, we have managed to create 5 personalities that keep on evolving with time. 

it is important to mention that the full installation includes 15-20 robots that react in real time to a single user, each robot bearing its unique kinetic model, forming a range of personalities that offers alternative identities to the user. 

We intend to further develop the hardware and the build quality of the robots, later include hands and a head in addition to torso, and fine tune the look and design of the robot exterior. We also plan on keep investigating the interaction models and to deepen our understanding of the different personalities and their effect on the user. With a swarm of robots at hand, we can further add modes of operation in which the group acts as identical clones or as individuals, creating an exciting and thought-provoking experience.
