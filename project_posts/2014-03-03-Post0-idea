DoppelGänger - Army of one
 
DoppelGänger is an exploration of a dynamic link between virtual and physical identities through the examination of human robot kinetic interaction. 

The introduction of the digital sphere has expanded the borders of our identity and has opened the vast world of multifaceted interactions with other identities and the reality around us. 

In DoppelGänger we create a Iive interaction between one human individual and an ‘army’ of him. These alter egos are made of 10-15 robots that represent personality variations on his kinetic behaviour. While a user moves in front of her DoppelGängers she can observe real time reflections of her movements that are processed through various personality filters we have programmed. This elaborate identity fest creates a feedback loop in which the human and robots, physical and virtual and preconditioned and spontaneous play together in chaotic harmony. 

DoppelGänger makes use of a variety of technologies recently introduced to the public and happily used and shared by creators, makers and inventors all around the world:
Arduino and physical actuators (Servo motors)
SimpleOpenNI and Kinect
Processing 2.0
